Overview:
The Erosion Control Project in Rigachikun Community aims to address the immediate challenges caused by erosion and riverbank, impacting local farmers' land and the accessibility of the only road in the area. The project is currently at the pilot stage, testing the feasibility and effectiveness of erosion control measures, including the construction of a retention wall and a temporary bridge, to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect the community infrastructure.


            Implementation Plan:
The project involves the installation of a retention wall along the riverbank to control water flow and prevent erosion, as well as the construction of a temporary bridge to provide access and manage water movement in the area. Community members and stakeholders are actively engaged in the project, providing insights, feedback, and support throughout the implementation process 

          Monitoring and Evaluation:
A monitoring and evaluation plan has been established to track the performance of the erosion control measures, gather feedback from the community, and assess the impact of the  project on protecting farmland, ensuring road access, and strengthening community resilience against erosion.

        Next Steps:
Based on the findings and outcomes of the project, further scaling and expansion of the erosion control measures may be considered to address the broader erosion challenges in Rigachikun Community. Regular updates, reports, and collaboration with stakeholders will drive the project forward towards sustainable and effective solutions for erosion control in the community.
